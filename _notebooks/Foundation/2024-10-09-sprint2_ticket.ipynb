    "\n",
    "My main goal for this lesson was to improve my soft skills through the way that I presented topics to my class.\n",
    "\n",
    "I always think of the battle between soft skills and technical skills like Steve Jobs vs Steve Wozniak. But which mentality to follow?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer was both. I believe this trimester I already had the qualities of Steve Wozniak as early this year and this summer I was advancing my Java knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sprint, my goal was to unlock my inner Steve Jobs.\n",

    "For this sprint 2 unit, my team and I taught Unit 2 of CollegeBoard's AP Computer Science A course. In this Unit I made the section which tought Non-Void methods and method signatures. One highlihgt from my lesson was my development of the method golf game.\n",

    "2 -> 0.75 (?) -> missing lots of things\n",
    "1 -> 0.55 -> incomplete/didn't do it\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of what would impress us, my team was transparent in the sense that we would give extra points based on originality, effort, and output. This was all done while making sure that the average is intact to prevent grade inflation.\n",

    "## Section 3: Homework and Understanding Review\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of my homework, these are somethings I did well but some things I could also improve upon\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Went Great:\n",
    "1. üÖ∞Ô∏è I scored 0.97 on 2 homeworks (highest in period 3). Everytime I go back to review the comments and it turns out that graders were impressed when I showed them something visually appealing which showed effort and was original\n",
    "2. ü§ö I engaged in all of the lessons and contributed to my team during jeopardies. As someone on the front lines, I won most of the team teach games!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùå Could Improve Upon:\n",
    "1. üôÅ I submitted one homework late! What is the point of putitng in so much effort if what I submitted got late credit??\n",
    "2. üôÅ For the last two hacks, I forgot to make a sort of section menu on my homework page. I just don't think it would be fair for graders to have to hunt through 1 student's homework\n",

    "### Unit Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unit 1 (Datatypes, the Stack and the Heap):\n",
    "    1. Primitive datatypes specify size and information\n",
    "    2. The `ints` are stored from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. `doubles` can store up to 15 digits\n",
    "    3. Reference types refer to objects instead of storing them as datatypes\n",
    "    4. The stack is used to store temporary variables (using push and pop), the heap stores via allocation and is used to store things like reference types\n",
    "- Unit 2 (Classes and Methods):\n",
    "    1. Classes are a way to encapsulate methods\n",
    "    2. Classes can also be used as objects\n",
    "    3. There are different settings you can give a method using signatures\n",
    "    4. Wrapper classes are used to extend functionality of primitive classes\n",
    "- Unit 3 (Booleans): \n",
    "    1. Booleans are used to control the flow of logic\n",
    "    2. Boolean datatype is true and false\n",
    "    3. DeMorgan's law of negation states that A and B is the same as not A or not B\n",
    "- Unit 4 (Iteration):\n",
    "    1. You can iterate through an array forward using `(int i=0; i < array.length; i++)`\n",
    "    2. You can iterate through an array forward using `(int i=array.length; i < 0; i--)`\n",
    "- Unit 5 (Writing Classes):\n",
    "    1. Classes can be used to store methods or manupulate them\n",
    "    2. When writing a class, you may use constructors\n",
    "    3. Utilizing getter and setter methods is ideal for changing and monitoring objects\n",
    "- Unit 6 (Arrays): \n",
    "    1. An array of ints can be sorted, searching too can be employed\n",
    "    2. Some key algorithms are binary search and selection sort\n",
    "- Unit 7 (Arraylists):\n",
    "    1. ArrayLists in Java automatically resize when elements are added or removed.\n",
    "    2. They maintain the order of elements as they were inserted.\n",
    "- Unit 8 (2D Arrays):\n",
    "    1. 2D arrays can be treated like matrices\n",
    "    2. Nexted for loops can be used to iterate through them\n",
    "    3. Images can be made using all of these 2D Arrays.\n",
    "- Unit 9 (Inheritance):\n",
    "    1. In a super class, another child class can be declared\n",
    "    2. The child can inherit traits and attributes from the super class\n",
