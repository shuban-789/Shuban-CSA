    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static int mystery(int[] arr)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    int x = 0;\n",
    "    for (int k = 0; k < arr.length; k = k + 2)\n",
    "        x = x + arr[k]\n",
    "    return x\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Assume that the array nums has been declared and initialized as follows.\n",
    "`int [ ] nums = { 3, 6, 1, 0, 1, 4, 2};`\n",
    "What value will be returned as a result of the call mystery(nums) ?\n",
    "\n",
    "A 5 ‚ùå\n",
    "B 6\n",
    "C 7 ‚úÖ\n",
    "D 10\n",
    "E 17\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The program is a simple sum program which is adding every other number in the array. The mistake I made here was I accidentally calculated the value of the um for `k = k + 3`. I really need to read the question closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int x = 7;\n",
    "int y = 3;\n",
    "\n",
    "if ((x < 10) && (y < 0))\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"Value is: \" + x * y);\n",

    "```\n",
    "What is printed as a result of executing the code segment\n",
    "\n",
    "A Value is: 21\n",
    "B Value is: 2.333333 ‚ùå\n",
    "C Value is: 2 ‚úÖ\n",
    "D Value is: 0\n",
    "E Value is: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The program uses Java rules of algebra with division. Integer division is used. Unlick Java, floating point devision is not used by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 10\n",
    "Directions: Select the choice that best fits each statement. The following question(s) refer to the following information\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following instance variable and methods. You may assume that data has been initialized with length > 0. The methods are intended to return the index of an array element equal to target, or -1 if no such element exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "private int[] data;\n",
    "\n",
    "public int seqSearchRec(int target)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    return seqSearchRecHelper(target, data.length - 1);\n",

    "    else\n",
    "    return seqSearchRecHelper(target, last - 1)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For which of the following test cases will the call seqSearchRec(5) always result in an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "    I data contains only one element.\n",
    "\n",
    "    II data does not contain the value 5.\n",

    "B II only ‚úÖ\n",
    "C III only\n",
    "D I and II only ‚ùå\n",
    "E I, II, and III\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Choice I will return the correct value only if the element in the array with one element was `target`. In this case, with the first call to `seqSearchRecHelper`, the value of `data[0]` would be `target` and `0` would be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 18\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that myList is an ArrayList that has been correctly constructed and populated with objects. Which of the following expressions produces a valid random index for myList?\n",
    "\n",
    "A (int) (Math.random()*myList.size()) - 1\n",
    "B. (int)(Math.random()*myList.size()) ‚úÖ\n",
    "C. (int)(Math.random()*myList.size()) + 1\n",
    "D. (int)(Math.random()*(myList.size()+1))\n",
    "E. Math.random(myList.size()) ‚ùå\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The `Math.random()` method does not take a parameter. This statement will cuase a compile time error\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 21\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following method, which is intended to return the element of a 2-dimensional array that is closest in value to a specified number, val.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "/** @return the element of a 2-dimensional array mat whose value is closest to val */\n",

    "    {\n",
    "        for (double num : mat)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            if ( /* missing code */)\n",
    "            {\n",

    "                minDiff = Math.abs(num - val)\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",

    "A. val - row[num] < minDiff\n",
    "B. Math.abs(num - minDiff) < minDiff ‚ùå\n",
    "C. val - num < 0.0\n",
    "D. Math.abs(num - val) < minDiff ‚úÖ\n",
    "E. Math.abs(row[num] - val) < minDiff\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: To find the value that is closest to `val`, the algorithm needs to calculate the positive difference between `num` and `val`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 23\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following instance variable and method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "private List<String> animals;\n",
    "\n",
    "public void manipulate()\n",
    "{\n",

    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that animals has been instantiated and initialized with the following contents. `[\"bear\", \"zebra\", \"bass\", \"cat\", \"koala\", \"baboon\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "A. [\"baboon\", \"zebra\", \"bass\", \"cat\", \"bear\", \"koala\"]\n",
    "B. [\"bear\", \"zebra\", \"bass\", \"cat\", \"koala\", \"baboon\"] ‚úÖ\n",
    "C. [\"baboon\", \"bear\", \"zebra\", \"bass\", \"cat\", \"koala\"] ‚ùå\n",
    "D. [\"bear\", \"baboon\", \"zebra\", \"bass\", \"cat\", \"koala\"]\n",
    "E. [\"zebra\", \"cat\", \"koala\", \"baboon\", \"bass\", \"bear\"] \n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: List is an interface, whch an `ArrayList` implemements. This would be correct only if the remove occurred before the size was calculated in the statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 28\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static int mystery(int n)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    int x = 1;\n",
    "    int y = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Point A\n",
    "    while (n > 2)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        x = x + y\n",
    "        // Point B\n",
    "\n",
    "        y = x - y;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Point C\n",
    "    return x;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A. x will sometimes be 1 at // Point B.\n",
    "B. x will never be 1 at // Point C. ‚ùå\n",
    "C. n will never be greater than 2 at // Point A.\n",
    "D. n will sometimes be greater than 2 at // Point C.\n",
    "E. n will always be greater than 2 at // Point B. ‚úÖ\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: If the value of n is 2 or less in the original call to the method mystery, the loop will be skipped and x will be 1 at Point C\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 29\n",
    "\n",
    "![i7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shuban-789/Markdown-images/refs/heads/main/Screenshot%202024-11-19%20091908.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: This will print `4, 16, 64` since `k` is assigned to the value of `k * 4` for each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 34 ‚≠ê\n",
    "\n",

    "        // Missing code\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following replacements for `/* missing code*/` will correctly implement the Circle constructor?\n",
    "\n",
    "I. \n",

    "A. I only\n",
    "B. II only ‚úÖ\n",
    "C. III only\n",
    "D. II and III only ‚ùå\n",
    "E. I, II, and III\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Choice III uses the default `Point` constructor to assign `center` a new `Point` with `x` and `y` both equal to `0`. It attempts to update `x` and `y`, however since they are private instance variables in `Point`, they are not able to be accessed directly in `Circle`. This code will cause a compile time error.\n",

    "### Question 39\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following recursive method\n",
    "```java\n",

    "C. 12\n",
    "D. 16 ‚úÖ\n",
    "E. 18 ‚ùå\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The value of `recur(9)` is 18. However, this call was made withing another recursive call and is not the final return value\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 40\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following recursive method\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static void whatsItDo(String str)\n",
