    "- Players are give a selection of multiple news outlets to choose from\n",
    "- They must successfully sort all of the outlets in terms of bias for points\n",
    "- A higher accuracy will result in a higher point count.\n",

    "## Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heap sort algorithm sorts scores on the leaderboard\n",
    "- Everytime a score is submitted via POST, the backend captures it and feeds it into the database\n",
    "- Everytime the leaderboard needs to be shown, the current leaderboard is fetched via GET\n",

    "## Frontend\n",
    "\n",
    "- The actual logic for the game lies in the frontend\n",
    "- An algorithm is used to randomize the news outlets and make the game more fair\n",
    "- Accessible UI and leaderboard, scores are sent and retrieved from the database.\n",

    "## Patch Fixes (2/28)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Saaras, a devoted player, found a bug in my game after playing it for so long. The issue was that the randomization algorithm was not too effective. I just forgot to rescramble. The bug s now officially fixed\n"
