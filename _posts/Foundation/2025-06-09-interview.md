## Project Overview for AP CSA

### üì∞ Media Bias Game

**Role:** Sole Developer  
**Tech Stack:** Spring Boot, GitHub Pages, Scss, Java, JavaScript

**Description:**  
The Media Bias Game is an interactive educational tool designed to help users recognize and understand political bias in news media. The game engages players through scenario-based decision making and aims to foster media literacy, which is a key foundational part of Del Norte's Spanish learning curriculum.

#### üîß Key Contributions:
- **Full-stack Development:** Built the entire project from scratch, including both frontend and backend systems.
- **Frontend Interface:** Developed a clean and responsive UI for intuitive interaction and seamless gameplay.
- **Backend Architecture:** Engineered server-side logic for data storage, game mechanics, and leaderboard.
- **Game Logic & Mechanics:** Implemented gameplay elements like randomization, scoring systems, and difficulty management.
- **Deployment & Testing:** Managed deployment and QA to ensure cross-platform stability and performance.

### üñ•Ô∏è Crypto Mining Simulation

**Role:** Energy Systems Designer & Architect  
**Tech Stack:** Spring Boot, GitHub Pages, Scss, Java, JavaScript

**Description:**  
The Crypto Mining Simulation is a strategic game where players simulate cryptocurrency mining by building virtual mining rigs and managing energy, hardware, and profit margins.

#### üîß Key Contributions:
- **System Architecture:** Designed the mining ecosystem, structuring how rigs operate and evolve over time.
- **Energy System Design:** Developed an energy management system modeling real-world power consumption and trade-offs.
- **Dependency Logistics:** Defined interdependent relationships between:
  - **GPUs:** Hashrate, energy usage, and upgrade logic.
  - **Hardware:** Cooling, scalability, and storage limits.
  - **Energy Systems:** Power sources, costs, and efficiency ratings.
- **Game Balancing:** Tuned simulation parameters for dynamic gameplay and realistic trade-offs.

## N@TM Retrospective: Crypto Mining

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/754ff989-fa1e-4732-aed3-ac09662a567c)

Stepping into Night at the Museum, I knew the evening was going to be memorable‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt expect just how curious, engaged, and energized everyone would be around a game about‚Ä¶ crypto mining.

I had set up a demo station featuring my Crypto Mining Simulation, a strategic game where players manage virtual mining rigs, juggle power costs, and optimize GPUs for max profit. It was fun watching visitors‚Äô faces shift from "I don't really get crypto..." to "Wait, so I can underclock my rig to save energy?" The game became a perfect entry point into explaining complex systems like hash rates, cooling logistics, and energy efficiency‚Äîwithout needing to touch a single line of code.

### How I Presented
I focused on three core aspects during my demo:

- System Architecture ‚Äì I walked people through how each component (GPU, hardware, energy) interacts dynamically in the game.

- Real-world Parallels ‚Äì I tied in real mining hardware, the cost of electricity, and thermal limits to show how simulation meets reality.

- Interactive Play ‚Äì I let guests try the simulation firsthand, answering questions as they played and encouraging them to optimize builds for max profit.

### Common Questions

- How close is this a simulation to the real world?

- Does this work with real charts and values?

- Does this work with real money?


Overall, presenting at Night at the Museum was not just an opportunity to showcase a project‚Äîit was a chance to spark conversations about energy, economics, and ethics in technology. Seeing people connect to the system I designed, across ages and backgrounds, made every hour I spent planning dependencies and balancing game mechanics completely worth it.

Grid Power ‚Äì cheap but unstable
Renewables ‚Äì stable but capped
Premium Sources ‚Äì costly but high output

üîß GPU & Energy Integration
Each GPU has:

- Hashrate
- Power draw (watts)
- Thermal output
- ower usage affects:
- Mining speed
- Cooling requirements
- Overall profit

üè™ Energy Plan Shop

Built a shop system with:

- Unlockable energy plans
