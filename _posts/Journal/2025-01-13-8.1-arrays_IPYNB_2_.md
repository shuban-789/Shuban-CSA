# Accessing and Updating Elements in a 2D Array

## Important Tips to Remember:
	•	Array indices start at 0: The first row and first column are at index 0.
	•	Relative positions: Always subtract 1 to determine the correct index relative to the 1-based numbering.

## Accessing Elements

To access an element in a 2D array, use the following format:

arr[row][column]

## Updating Elements

To update an element in a 2D array, assign a new value using this format:

variable_name[row][column] = new_value

For example:
If you want to change the value in the second row and third column, use:

array[1][2] = new_value

## Popcorn Hack:
Write code to access the scores: 92, 70, 93 and change the last score to 100


```python
# Example 2D array representing the scores
scores = [
    [100, 85, 95, 96],  # Student0
    [98, 100, 100, 95], # Student1
    [92, 100, 98, 100], # Student2
    [100, 100, 97, 99], # Student3
    [100, 100, 100, 70],# Student4
    [100, 100, 99, 98], # Student5
    [100, 94, 100, 93]  # Student6
]
```

## Essential points:
- When accessing elements at arr[first][second], the first index is used for rows, and the second index is used for columns
- Square brackets [row][col] are used to access and modify an element of a 2d array.
